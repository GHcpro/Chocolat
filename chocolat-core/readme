This is the educational toy programming language made by me, Ensatone...
This includes the concepts of lexer,parser and interpreter
The implementation is not thorough and it is only made to understand the steps and algorithms behind how a programming language works
The compiler is written in io language so the user needs to download iolang and extract the files into the chocolat-core folder
To compile the user's source code, the user needs to type "io chocolatc.io" in the command line
To run the program or the produced instruction, the user needs to type "chocolat" in windows or "./chocolat" in linux in the command line

Hope you enjoy!!!
